## Introduction
An Android application aimed at extrapolating the data from the internal
sensors. The compass is calculated by doing a matric rotation on the
acceleration and the magnetic field matrix values.

## Research
This android application is aimed at trying to improve the accuracy of GPS
readings in doors. Proof of concept will display the displacement of movement by
using the heading and distance traveled to calculate the path.

## Contributions
This application utilises the open source contributions from @bagilevi.
